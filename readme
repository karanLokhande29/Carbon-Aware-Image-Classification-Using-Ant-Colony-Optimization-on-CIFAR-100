# Carbon-Aware Image Classification with ACO (CIFAR-100)

This project implements a "Green AI" approach to image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset. It utilizes **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** to automate hyperparameter tuning and model selection, specifically optimizing for a balance between **Test Accuracy** and **Carbon Emissions (CO₂)**.

The system evaluates both Deep Learning (ResNet-18) and Classical Machine Learning models (SVM, XGBoost, etc.) using a two-stage ACO process.

## Key Features

* **Carbon Tracking:** Integrated with **CodeCarbon** to measure real-time CO₂ emissions (kg) for every training run.
* **Hybrid Modeling:**
    * **Deep Learning:** Fine-tuned ResNet-18 (with Automatic Mixed Precision).
    * **Classical ML:** SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, kNN, and Logistic Regression trained on PCA-reduced ResNet-18 embeddings.
* **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):**
    * **Intra-Algorithm ACO:** Swarm-based search for the best hyperparameters *within* each algorithm type.
    * **Inter-Algorithm ACO:** High-level selection to identify the best overall model across all types.
* **Dataset:** CIFAR-100 (20k "fast train" split for efficiency).

## Methodology

1.  **Feature Extraction:** Images are passed through a pre-trained **ResNet-18** (ImageNet weights) to generate embeddings, which are reduced to 100 dimensions using **PCA**.
2.  **Search Space:** The ACO algorithm explores a defined grid of hyperparameters (e.g., Learning Rate, Batch Size for ResNet; C, Gamma for SVM; n_estimators for Random Forest).
3.  **Optimization Function:** The "pheromone" deposit in ACO is calculated based on a weighted combination of **Validation Accuracy** and **CO₂ Emissions**.
4.  **Selection:** The system outputs a "Champion" model that offers the best trade-off.
